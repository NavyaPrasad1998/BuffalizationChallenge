# BuffalizationChallenge
data visualization of our CU Boulder tree dataset

📖 Description:
This interactive map provides a geospatial visualization of trees in the Historic District of CU Boulder (Norlin Quad and adjacent areas).

Using data on tree species, genus, canopy spread, and height, this map allows users to explore the diversity of trees across the campus.

Key Features:

✅ Tree Type Differentiation:

🌳 Deciduous Trees are represented as circles

🌲 Coniferous Trees are represented as triangles


✅ Size Scaling:

The size of each marker is proportional to the tree’s Canopy Spread & Height, allowing for easy identification of larger and smaller trees.


✅ Informative Popups:

Click on any marker to reveal tree details, including:

🌱 Common Name

🌿 Genus & Species

📏 Canopy Spread (m)

🌲 Height (m)


This visualization showcases urban biodiversity and helps in understanding tree distribution in an engaging and interactive format.
